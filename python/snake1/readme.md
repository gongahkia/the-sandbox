# Snake Game (except not really)

Was challenged by a friend to create a retro game in a few hours during a free afternoon. Instead of figuring out how to implement gravity in a 2-D platformer, resorted to the classic snake, before I realized I had bitten off much more than I could chew.
Overall, I'm satisifed with my attempt, and glad that the code isn't too messy.

----------

## What could be improved:

1. The snake does not increase length when it consumes food, and I am unclear on how to implement the snake's body logic, as well as handling snake body collisions. My best guess is to create two different *Class objects*, **snake_head** and **snake_body**. Will need to work on implementing this if I decide to rework this game.
2. Implementing a timer-based system (importing a Python library that refreshes the game on a constant timed loop), such that the user only has to direct the snake with *[W/A/S/D]* keys, with no need to press enter.

That said, thanks for sticking around!
