# Spotify Please

The [Spotify Writeable Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) is [currently deprecated](https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/1h2ifec/spotifys_new_api_terms_are_a_major_blow_to/) and no longer availble for public use.

It's frustrating to edit playlists in bulk.

But things don't have to be that way.
