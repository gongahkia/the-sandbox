## Resolving my longstanding WSL2 missing Dart SDK issue

1. Refer to the below articles first.
    1. [*Get the Dart SDK*](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
    2. [*Accessing WSL2 Files from Windowsâ€™ File Explorer*](https://dev.to/miftahafina/accessing-wsl2-files-from-windows-file-explorer-308o) by Miftah Afina
2. If the above fixes don't work and the VSCode error still arises, just ensure that running `flutter doctor` in the WSL2 terminal shows no errors. *(This confirms the issue is with VSCode's identification of WSL2 files.)*
